Project Title: Exploratory Analysis and K-Means Clustering of Seed Dataset

Overview:

This GitHub repository contains code and resources for an exploratory analysis and K-means clustering of a seed dataset. The project aims to uncover patterns and insights within the data through data preprocessing, scaling, and the application of K-means clustering.

Files and Directories:

data/seeds.csv: The dataset used for analysis.
src/main.py: Main Python script containing the analysis code.
models/kmeans.pkl: Serialized K-means clustering model.
README.md: Documentation providing an overview, setup instructions, and usage details.
Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Required Python packages: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, yellowbrick
Setup:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-bcguilherme/seed-clustering.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd seed-clustering
Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:

Run the main analysis script: python src/main.py
View visualizations and insights generated during the analysis.
The serialized K-means model is saved in models/kmeans.pkl for future use.
Exploratory Analysis:

Basic quality checks for missing values and duplicated rows.
Data scaling for better clustering performance.
Visualization of the scaled data distribution through box plots.
K-Means Clustering:

Utilization of the elbow method and silhouette scores to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
Application of K-means clustering with the chosen K value.
Cluster analysis, including mean feature values for each cluster.
Display of cluster sizes.
Model Serialization:

The trained K-means clustering model is serialized using pickle and saved for future use.
Future Improvements:

Explore additional clustering algorithms.
Enhance visualizations for better interpretation.
Consider feature engineering for improved clustering results.
